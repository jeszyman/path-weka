* Best Anemia Predictor Competition
** Introduction

In this exercise, you will use the principles of data pre-processing, data mining, and machine learning to solve a supervised machine learning classifier problem. The classifier will predict future anemia based on a patient's current CBC. This is a competition, and the best performing classifiers will win prizes!

** Setup

If you have not already done so, download and install the Weka program: 

https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html

Get the stable version for your operating system including the Java VM. For example, if you are on Windows, then get the "self-extracting executable for 64-bit Windows that includes Oracle's 64-bit Java VM 1.8"
(This one)
[[file:./tutorial-images/windows-dl-ex.png]]

Follow the install instructions in the downloaded file.

You do not need to install any additional packages, just the base Weka program is enough for this exercise.  

** Data

We will use the CBC data from last week's data mining and pre-processing lecture. __The .csv file was emailed to you (NEW-cbc.csv).__ All of these CBC results have normal hemoglobin and hematocrit, but half of the patients will be anemic on their next CBC. These subsequent CBCs are not included, but rather the patients who will become anemic are identified in the subsAnemia column. The other half of the included CBC results are from patients who were not anemic on their next CBC (subs-anemia = "No").

_Your job is to use the available CBC data to predict which patients will become anemic.__ 
This is an example of supervised learning where we will present the computer with examples of our two outcomes (subsequently anemic versus subsequently not anemic) and ask the computer to learn rules or patterns which 


patients who will become anemic versus patients who will notNote: these results were selected so that the subs-anemia groups have comparable distributions of hematocrit in the first result (i.e. hemoglobin or hematocrit on their own will not be good predictors of future anemia for this dataset). Check out the R script in this GitHub repository to see how these data were generated and de-identified.


Recall, this was several days of CBC with differential results from Cerner Millennium that went through the following pre-preprocessing steps: 

1. Long-to-wide format change for DTAs
2. Subset to CBCs where patient was not currently anemic
3. Subset to a case-control series with comparable distributions of hemoglobin and hematocrit: 
  - Cases: Patient's next CBC was anemic
  - Control: Patient's next CBC was not anemic 
4. Removed patient identifiers

(See cbc-preprocess.R)

** Pre-processing and Data Mining

The first step will be data pre-processing and data mining to understand the dataset. You will need to make decisions about which data to include, exclude, and modify, before applying machine learning techniques. For example, some CBCs in the dataset do not have complete differential results. You will decide whether to keep or exclude this data from analysis (or possibly even impute the missing values). You will decide whether the scale of each column of data is appropriate or should be changed (e.g. normalized) before analysis. This work can be done in any program you choose, such as Excel. Refer back to the data pre-processing and data mining lecture for help. 

** Supervised Machine Learning Classifier

The actual machine learning will be done in a program called [[https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/][Weka]]. Weka is a powerful but easy to use machine learning platform with a graphical, point-and-click interface. 

*** Install Weka and Import Data

[[https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html][Download]] a stable version of Weka for your operating system, and follow the installation instructions from the website. To import the CBC data that you have pre-processed, save that data as a comma-separated value (.csv) file. You can save as csv in Excel. Be sure the top of the spreadsheet contains only a single row of column labels, then only data beneath (see LINKexample). 

Now in the initial Weka window (Weka GUI Chooser), select ArffViewer the Tools menu. Open your csv in the ArffViewer. In the ArffViewer, you can modify the rows and columns of your data by right-clicking on them. The only important change to make is to identify an attribute as class- the column which describes the outcome you are trying to predict. Our classification attribute is subs-anemia. Right-click the column header for subs-anemia and select Attribute as Class. Now save as an .arff file type. 

*** Begin Classifying the Dataset

Back at the initial Weka GUI Chooser window, select the Weka Explorer program and open the .arff file you just created. 

- [ ] Preprocess tools

Select the Classify tab. Notice the setting for Classifier (ZeroR) and Cross-validation Folds (10). Recall the concept of cross-validation from Dr. Jackups machine learning lecture. Press start and look in the Classifier output window. Under  == Summary ==, you see about 1/2 of CBCs are correctly classified as preceding anemia or not (from the subs-anemia column) using the ZeroR algorithm. This is because ZeroR just picks the most prevalent category and assigns every instance to that category. This is your baseline, worst possible classifier.

You objective is to improve this classifier to get the highest possible correct classification using 10-fold cross validation. You will need to draw on strategies from the machine learning and data pre-processing lectures. These strategies include: 

- Optimize your dataset
  - Unless you direct Weka otherwise, it will use all the variables and all of the CBC values in your dataset, as is, for classification. You may improve your classification by changing the input data- using less variables, normalizing variables, re-scaling variables, or excluding incomplete values. 
- Select a better classification algorithm
  - The Choose button under the Classifier heading will direct you to a wide selection of classifier methods. 
  - [ ] Some common methods for this type of exercise include...
- Optimize your classifier algorithm
  - Each classifier algorithm has a set of pre-selected input parameters which are probably not optimized for this dataset. Select the text window to the right of the Choose button to change these parameters, then re-run to see if your classification gets better. 
  - [ ] These are explained in LINK

** Competition 

Iterate through the above process as much as you like to improve your classification.
