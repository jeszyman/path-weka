- Best Classifier Exercise
  - You will use the principles of data pre-processing, data mining, and machine learning to create a supervised machine learning classifier. The classifier will predict future anemia based on a patient's last available CBC. This is a competition, and the best performing classifiers will win prizes!
  - Data Acquisition and Pre-processing
    - The dataset you will be working with is de-identifed CBC with differential results from our LIS database. All of these CBC results have normal hemoglobin and hematocrit, but half of the patients were anemic on their next CBC. The subsequent, anemic CBC is not shown, but these patients are identified in the subs-anemia column with the value "Yes". The other half of the CBCs are from patients who were not anemic on their next result (subs-anemia = "No"). 
These results were selected so that the subs-anemia groups had comparable distributions of hematocrit in the first result. Check out the R script to see how these data were generated.
  - Pre-processing and Data Mining
    - Your job is to use the available CBC data to predict which patients will become anemic. The first step will be data pre-processing and data mining to understand the dataset. You will need to make decisions about which data to include, exclude, and modify, before applying machine learning techniques. For example, some CBCs in the dataset do not have complete differential results. You will decide whether to keep or exclude this data from analysis (or possibly even impute the missing values). You will decide whether the scale of each column of data is appropriate or should be changed (e.g. normalized) before analysis. This work can be done in any program you choose, such as Excel.
