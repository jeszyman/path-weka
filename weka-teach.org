* Best Anemia Predictor Competition
** Introduction

In this exercise, you will use the principles of data pre-processing, data mining, and machine learning to create a supervised machine learning classifier. The classifier will predict future anemia based on a patient's last available CBC. This is a competition, and the best performing classifiers will win prizes!

** TODO Learning Objectives

SBP7: Informatics: Explains, discusses, classifies, and applies clinical informatics (AP/CP)
Level 3: Applies informatics skills as needed in project management (data management, computational statistics)

- Apply principles from data pre-processing and data mining to 
- Use supervised machine learning algorithms to optimize a classifier
 
** Dataset

Data will be made available when the competition is released. 

The dataset you will be working with is de-identified CBC and differential results from our LIS database. All of these CBC results have normal hemoglobin and hematocrit, but half of the patients will be anemic on their next CBC. The subsequent, anemic CBC is not shown, but these patients are identified in the subs-anemia column with the value "Yes". The other half of the included CBC results are from patients who were not anemic on their next CBC (subs-anemia = "No"). 

_Your job is to use the available CBC data to predict which patients will become anemic._ Note: these results were selected so that the subs-anemia groups have comparable distributions of hematocrit in the first result (i.e. hemoglobin or hematocrit on their own will not be good predictors of future anemia for this dataset). Check out the R script in this GitHub repository to see how these data were generated and de-identified.

** Pre-processing and Data Mining

The first step will be data pre-processing and data mining to understand the dataset. You will need to make decisions about which data to include, exclude, and modify, before applying machine learning techniques. For example, some CBCs in the dataset do not have complete differential results. You will decide whether to keep or exclude this data from analysis (or possibly even impute the missing values). You will decide whether the scale of each column of data is appropriate or should be changed (e.g. normalized) before analysis. This work can be done in any program you choose, such as Excel. Refer back to the data pre-processing and data mining lecture for help. 

** Supervised Machine Learning Classifier

The actual machine learning will be done in a program called [[https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/][Weka]]. Weka is a powerful but easy to use machine learning platform with a graphical, point-and-click interface. 

*** Install Weka and Import Data

[[https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html][Download]] a stable version of Weka for your operating system, and follow the installation instructions from the website. To import the CBC data that you have pre-processed, save that data as a comma-separated value (.csv) file. You can save as csv in Excel. Be sure the top of the spreadsheet contains only a single row of column labels, then only data beneath (see LINKexample). 

Now in the initial Weka window (Weka GUI Chooser), select ArffViewer the Tools menu. Open your csv in the ArffViewer. In the ArffViewer, you can modify the rows and columns of your data by right-clicking on them. The only important change to make is to identify an attribute as class- the column which describes the outcome you are trying to predict. Our classification attribute is subs-anemia. Right-click the column header for subs-anemia and select Attribute as Class. Now save as an .arff file type. 

*** Begin Classifying the Dataset

Back at the initial Weka GUI Chooser window, select the Weka Explorer program and open the .arff file you just created. 

- [ ] Preprocess tools

Select the Classify tab. Notice the setting for Classifier (ZeroR) and Cross-validation Folds (10). Recall the concept of cross-validation from Dr. Jackups machine learning lecture. Press start and look in the Classifier output window. Under  == Summary ==, you see about 1/2 of CBCs are correctly classified as preceding anemia or not (from the subs-anemia column) using the ZeroR algorithm. This is because ZeroR just picks the most prevalent category and assigns every instance to that category. This is your baseline, worst possible classifier.

You objective is to improve this classifier to get the highest possible correct classification using 10-fold cross validation. You will need to draw on strategies from the machine learning and data pre-processing lectures. These strategies include: 

- Optimize your dataset
  - Unless you direct Weka otherwise, it will use all the variables and all of the CBC values in your dataset, as is, for classification. You may improve your classification by changing the input data- using less variables, normalizing variables, re-scaling variables, or excluding incomplete values. 
- Select a better classification algorithm
  - The Choose button under the Classifier heading will direct you to a wide selection of classifier methods. 
  - [ ] Some common methods for this type of exercise include...
- Optimize your classifier algorithm
  - Each classifier algorithm has a set of pre-selected input parameters which are probably not optimized for this dataset. Select the text window to the right of the Choose button to change these parameters, then re-run to see if your classification gets better. 
  - [ ] These are explained in LINK

Iterate through the above process as much as you like to improve your classification.
